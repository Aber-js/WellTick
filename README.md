**Empowering Accessibility, One Tap at a Time**

---

## 🌍 What is Welltick?
Welltick is a mobile‑first app designed with care and purpose to support people living with disabilities. It’s more than just a utility—it’s a companion that helps users feel seen, heard, safe, and connected.

We built Welltick during a social‑good, health‑focused hackathon to address the real needs of a deeply underserved community. Every screen, feature, and interaction was crafted with empathy, accessibility, and dignity at its core.

## 💡 Why Welltick?
Too many people with disabilities face daily barriers—both physical and digital. Welltick changes that by offering tools that:

- Improve communication  
- Enhance independence  
- Build stronger community support  
- Promote personal safety and wellbeing  

Welltick meets people where they are and supports them in living more freely—on their own terms.

## ❤️ Guiding Principles
1. Accessibility is a right, not a feature.  
2. Design **with**, not just **for**.  
3. Technology should lift everyone—especially those left behind.  
4. Small improvements can mean the world to someone.
